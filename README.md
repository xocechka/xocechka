# 👋 Hi, I'm José Javier Quesada Madrigal  
🔹 Software Engineer | University Professor
📍 Based in **Cuba**  

Welcome to my GitHub! 

As a university professor and software engineer, I am passionate about shaping the next generation of developers and advancing the field of software engineering.

Beyond the classroom, I am deeply interested in software design, clean architecture, and domain-driven design. I believe that well-structured, maintainable, and scalable software is key to building long-lasting digital solutions. My work focuses on designing robust backend systems, refining API architectures, and applying best practices in software engineering to create efficient and adaptable applications.

I am committed to continuous learning and sharing knowledge, whether through teaching, mentoring, or contributing to discussions on modern software development methodologies. My goal is to inspire both students and professionals to embrace engineering principles that lead to high-quality, sustainable software solutions.
